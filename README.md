## Usage

There are two methods to use this application:

1. Use the link above to access the deployed application.
2. To use this back-end application, fork the repository, clone the repository, or download the ZIP file to access the code for yourself. This will require you to have a text editor. I recommend Visual Studio Code, but there are a plethora of other options available.

Next, follow the Installation instructions below.

Then, open the application folder and enter `npm run start` and open the app at http://localhost:3000/.

## Installation
1. Ensure node.js is installed. 
3. Create a `package.json` file by entering the `npm init -y` command in the terminal. 
4. Open the app in the terminal and enter the following command to install required dependencies: `npm install`
