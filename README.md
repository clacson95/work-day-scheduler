1. Use the link above to access the deployed application.
2. To use this back-end application, fork the repository, clone the repository, or download the ZIP file to access the code for yourself. This will require you to have a text editor. I recommend Visual Studio Code, but there are a plethora of other options available.

Then, simply open the app at http://localhost:3000/.
